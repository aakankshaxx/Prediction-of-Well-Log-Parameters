# Prediction-of-Well-Log-Parameters
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based approach for predicting well log parameters in the petroleum industry. It proposes a comprehensive approach for well data cleaning and prediction of missing values. The approach utilises advanced data cleaning techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms to rectify missing values. Well log datasets are preprocessed to extract relevant features capturing spatial and temporal variations. Various machine learning algorithms are employed, trained on the datasets, and evaluated using metrics such as root mean squared error. The interpretability of the models is explored, providing insights into the influencing factors. Real-world well log datasets are used for validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in improving reservoir characterization and decision-making. 
In this project, I was asked to experiment with a real world dataset, and to explore how machine learning algorithms can be used to find the patterns in data. I was expected to gain experience using common data-mining and machine learning library; pandas.
